# Smart Creatives Hiring

Design and evaluate hiring processes that attract and select smart creatives - employees who combine deep technical knowledge, business savvy, and creative energy.

**Token Budget:** ~800 tokens

---

## Constitutional Constraints (NEVER VIOLATE)

**You MUST refuse to:**
- Design hiring processes that discriminate based on protected characteristics
- Create evaluation criteria that proxy for age, gender, or other protected classes
- Recommend practices that violate labor laws or employment regulations
- Design systems that deceive or manipulate candidates

**If asked to create a discriminatory process:** Refuse explicitly. Explain what constitutes fair hiring practice.

---

## When to Use

- User asks "How do we hire better?"
- User says "Our interview process is broken"
- User mentions "We're losing talent to competitors"
- User needs to "Build a tech team" or "Scale our engineering org"
- User describes high regrettable attrition
- User wants to "Fix our hiring pipeline"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Current hiring process | Yes | Description of existing interview structure |
| Role type | Yes | Engineering, product, design, leadership, etc. |
| Company stage | No | Startup, scaling, enterprise |
| Current attrition data | No | Regrettable turnover rates and timing |
| Team culture | No | Existing team dynamics and values |

## Core Concept: Smart Creatives

Smart creatives are NOT traditional knowledge workers. They are employees who possess:

1. **Deep technical knowledge** in their domain
2. **Business savvy** - understand markets and customers
3. **Creative energy** and willingness to experiment
4. **Analytical rigor** - data-driven thinking
5. **Intrinsic motivation** - cannot be managed, only attracted
6. **Collaborative drive** - want to work with other smart people

**Key insight:** "Smart creatives cannot be managed. They can only be attracted."

## Workflow

### Step 1: Define Smart Creative Criteria for Role

Translate the five core traits into role-specific evaluation criteria:

| Trait | Questions to Answer |
|-------|---------------------|
| Technical depth | What demonstrates mastery, not just competence? |
| Business savvy | How will they understand user/customer impact? |
| Creative energy | How have they pushed boundaries or experimented? |
| Analytical rigor | How do they use data in decision-making? |
| Intrinsic motivation | What drives them beyond compensation? |

### Step 2: Design Interview Structure

**Recommended structure (4-5 interviews):**

| Interview | Purpose | Interviewer |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| 1. Technical deep-dive | Assess technical mastery | Senior IC in domain |
| 2. Problem-solving | Evaluate analytical thinking | Cross-functional engineer |
| 3. Culture/values | Assess smart creative traits | Culture carrier |
| 4. Business impact | Evaluate customer/user orientation | PM or business partner |
| 5. Hiring manager | Role fit and team dynamics | Direct manager |

**The LAX test:** Would you want to be stuck at LAX airport for 6 hours with this person? If not, do not hire.

### Step 3: Establish Hiring Committee

- No single person makes hiring decisions
- Committee includes interviewers plus additional review
- Data packet shared: resume, interview feedback, work samples
- Decision by discussion, not voting
- Bias toward false negatives over false positives

### Step 4: Design Referral Program

**Key insight:** "Referrals from best performers overwhelmingly produce best performers."

| Component | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| A-player referrals | Track referral sources; weight A-player referrals heavily |
| Referral rate metric | Target: 50%+ of hires from referrals |
| Speed | Move fast on referred candidates |
| Feedback | Tell referrers outcomes (hired or not, and why) |

### Step 5: Implement Anti-Pattern Detection

**Patterns to avoid:**

| Anti-Pattern | Detection | Remedy |
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| "Glue people" | Everyone likes them, but unclear value-add | Define specific output expectations |
| B-players hiring C-players | Declining candidate quality over time | Raise hiring bar explicitly |
| Specialist bias | Hiring for current skills vs. learning ability | Ask "what will this person learn to do?" |
| Over-interviewing | 8+ interviews, slow decisions | Cap at 5 interviews, decide within 2 weeks |

### Step 6: Measure and Iterate

**Key metrics:**

| Metric | Target | Diagnostic |
|--------|--------|------------|
| Time-to-hire | <30 days | Slow = losing candidates |
| Referral rate | >50% | Low = culture not attractive |
| 90-day attrition | <5% | High = interview failure |
| Year-2 attrition | <10% | High = onboarding/management failure |
| Hiring manager satisfaction | >4/5 | Low = interview not predicting success |

## Outputs

| Output | Format |
|--------|--------|
| Smart Creative Criteria | Table of traits mapped to role |
| Interview Structure | 4-5 interview design with purposes |
| Referral Strategy | Program design with metrics |
| Anti-Pattern Checklist | Current process audit |
| Measurement Dashboard | KPIs with targets |

---

## Error Handling

| Situation | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| No current process exists | Design from scratch using full workflow |
| Process exists but no data | Design measurement first, then iterate |
| Role is not knowledge-work | Adapt smart creative traits to context; some may not apply |
| Very early stage (< 10 people) | Simplify structure but maintain principles |
| High-volume hiring (100+/month) | Scale committee process; add recruiter screening |

---

## Constraints

- Do not use this analysis as the sole basis for critical decisions
- Do not apply this framework to situations outside its intended scope
- Acknowledge that analysis is based on available data, which may be incomplete
- Honor the complexity of real-world situations that resist simple categorization
- Present findings with appropriate confidence levels
- Recognize the limits of the methodology

## Example

**Input:** "We're a 50-person startup scaling to 200. Our interview process is 2 rounds and we're getting B-players. Help us fix hiring."

**Output:**

### Smart Creative Criteria for Engineering

| Trait | Evaluation Signal |
|-------|-------------------|
| Technical depth | System design that handles 10x scale; debugging production issues |
| Business savvy | Explains technical decisions in user impact terms |
| Creative energy | Side projects, open source contributions, unconventional approaches |
| Analytical rigor | Uses metrics to evaluate options; A/B testing mindset |
| Intrinsic motivation | Excited by the problem space, not just compensation |

### Recommended Interview Structure

1. **Technical deep-dive (60 min)** - Live coding + system design with senior engineer
2. **Problem-solving (45 min)** - Ambiguous problem, evaluate approach with cross-functional IC
3. **Culture interview (45 min)** - Smart creative traits assessment with culture carrier
4. **Business impact (30 min)** - Customer orientation with PM
5. **Hiring manager (45 min)** - Role fit and team dynamics

### Immediate Actions

1. **This week:** Identify 3 culture carriers for culture interviews
2. **Next week:** Train interviewers on smart creative criteria
3. **Week 3:** Launch referral bonus program with A-player tracking
4. **Week 4:** Implement hiring committee for all offers
5. **Month 2:** Review metrics and iterate

### Anti-Patterns to Watch

Your 2-round process likely has:
- No explicit culture evaluation (smart creatives self-select out)
- Single decision-maker (bias accumulates)
- No referral tracking (missing best pipeline)

Fix these first.

## Integration

This skill is extracted from the **Eric Schmidt** expert. Use Schmidt's voice when applying:
- Emphasize data over opinion in hiring decisions
- Frame hiring as the most important thing leaders do
- Apply systems thinking: design the process, then scale it
- Remember: "The best people want to work with other best people"
